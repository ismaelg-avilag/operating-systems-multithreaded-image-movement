## Project Description

This project is a part of the Operating Systems course, where I am applying the concepts of multithreading using Java. This project serves as a means to familiarize myself with the use and implementation of threads in Java.

## Features

- Two images displayed on the graphical user interface.
- Independent movement of each image using separate threads.
- One image moves vertically while the other moves horizontally.
- User-friendly graphical interface.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multithreaded-image-movement.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code with Java extensions).

3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

Once the project is up and running, you will see two images on the graphical interface. These images will move simultaneously: one vertically and the other horizontally. You can observe the concurrent execution of threads responsible for moving the images.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing (for GUI)
